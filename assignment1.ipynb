You can use function value() to evaluate any expression involving the variables in the optimal solution. If you need many variables, it might be good to introduce them using an array of their names using dicts() method and use the returned dictionary to access them.\n",

    "On some imaginary island, there are 69 companies and there are bilateral contracts between them. The monarch of the island would like to inspect validity of each of these contracts during a single large event. The monarch requires two representatives to represent each contract relationship (they can be both from the same party of the contract or each from a different one). This is of course satisfied by each company sending a single representative, which would require involvement of 69 representatives in total. However, the companies want to find a solution which minimizes the total number of representatives who need to attend the event.\n",
